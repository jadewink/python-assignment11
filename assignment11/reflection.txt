Create a file in the assignment11 folder called reflection.txt, and put in the following thoughts:

Reflect on the differences between static and interactive visualizations.
Write a short paragraph discussing the advantages of using dashboards for real-time data exploration.
Explain how interactive tools like Plotly and Dash can improve data communication in professional settings.

Static visualizations are like snapshots—they're easy to read but don’t let you dig deeper. 
Interactive visualizations, let you explore the data by zooming, filtering, 
and hovering, which makes it easier to spot trends and patterns.
Dashboards are great for real-time data because they update instantly and let you explore information at first glance. 
They're perfect for quick decision-making.
Tools like Plotly and Dash make data more engaging by turning it into interactive visuals. 
This helps the user understand the data and come to conclusions, and communication can be clear and effective.
